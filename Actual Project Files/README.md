### Description
The CITS3001 Project is a game where students are required to implement agents for each team.
The goal of the game is to influence the agents of the green team into voting or not voting. The Red and Blue team can be thought of as "government bodies" where they are trying to win an election period. As such, they would like to get as much votes as possible from the green team.

### Teams and Agents

#### Blue Team
- One agent.

#### Red Team
- One agent.

#### Green Team
- 90% of the network population.

#### Grey Team
- Multiple Agents, depending on how many Green Agents are initialized.

### Included Files

#### `agents.py`
- File that contains class declarations and class functions for each team.

#### `auto_gamefile.py`
- Main file that runs the game in conjunction with agents.py.

### Running the program
